### Using Bun

If you prefer using Bun as your JavaScript runtime:

```bash
# Install dependencies with Bun
bun install

# Start development server
bun dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Run linting
bun run lint
```
## 📦 Package Management

### Recommended: Use npm for package management
To reduce conflicts between different environments and ensure consistency across all development setups, we recommend using **npm** as the package manager regardless of your preferred runtime.

### Runtime Options

You can use either **Bun** or **Node.js** as your JavaScript runtime while maintaining npm for package management:

**With Node.js runtime:**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**With Bun runtime:**
```bash
npm install  # Use npm for package management
bun --bun run dev  # Use Bun as runtime
```

This approach ensures all team members have the same dependency tree while allowing flexibility in runtime choice.
